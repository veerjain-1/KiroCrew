        {/* Keyed by the FULL repo scope, so a scope change remounts the card and
            no state can cross it. The card holds an uncommitted draft until the
            server answers and keeps it when a write fails, so an instance reused
            for a different repository would let a retry write one repo's typed
            value into another repo's settings — and the same remount is what
            drops a stale "saving"/"couldn't save" line that describes a write to
            the repo just navigated away from.

            `repoScopeKey`, the string this page's queries are already cached
            under, so the card's identity and its cache entry cannot disagree. It
            carries provider and host, which is the part that matters: `acme/widget`
            on GitHub and `acme/widget` on a GitLab instance are two different
            repositories with one slug, and the settings route keys on owner/repo
            alone — so that navigation reuses this whole page. */}
