/**
 * PapyrusPage — the Papyrus builtin app (route `/papyrus`).
 *
 * Two views behind one route:
 *
 * - **No paper open** → `ProjectList`, which follows the standard page layout
 *   (`PageHeader` + `px-6 pb-8` container + `StatCard` row + `Card` sections).
 * - **A paper open** → a split-pane workspace: file tree, Monaco source pane and
 *   diagnostics on the left; the rendered PDF on the right; an optional co-author
 *   chat panel beyond that. A paper and its PDF need the full viewport, so the
 *   editor is deliberately full-bleed and carries its own toolbar.
 *
 * All server state is React Query (`use-react-query`); the ONLY local state is the
 * editor buffer and which pane is showing, because a buffer is genuinely local
 * until saved.
 *
 * Save-and-compile is one action, bound to Cmd/Ctrl+S: the compiler reads the file
 * off disk, so compiling an unsaved buffer would silently typeset the previous
 * revision. That is why `saveAndCompile` awaits the save before it compiles.
