# Config Module

## Overview

Foreign-agent onboarding is gated independently by `dashboard.import_onboarded`,
migrated from the older `dashboard.onboarded`, and the settings it projects are
merged strictly (merge-only, never a wholesale replace). The loader preserves legacy
numeric strings and integral floats already present in a config file, while rejecting
booleans and non-integral, malformed, or non-finite values. Imported settings are
type-validated before they are written, and the CLI converts typed values before
writing.

The config module (`kiro_crew/config/loader.py`) loads runtime configuration from `~/.kiro/crew/config.json` using stdlib dataclasses with sensible defaults.

A feature whose section spends tokens on the user's behalf defaults to off and
documents its knobs in its own spec — `session_summary` is the current example
(see [session-summary.md](session-summary.md)), following the shape
`SkillsConfig` established: every field carries `_meta` label/help for the config
surfaces, out-of-range values are clamped with a warning rather than raising, and
a malformed section degrades to defaults so a hand-edited file cannot prevent the
gateway from starting.

## Data Home Location & Migration

KiroCrew's data root nests **under kiro-cli's own `~/.kiro/` base** so all
Kiro-family apps share a single directory a user can secure. `config_dir()`
(in `kiro_crew/config/paths.py`, re-exported from `kiro_crew/config/loader.py`)
is the single accessor and resolves to:

1. `$KIROCREW_HOME` when set (used as-is; refuses system directories like `/`,
   `/usr`, `/System`, `/etc`), else
2. `~/.kiro/crew` (the default).

**One-time migration.** On the first launch after upgrading an existing install,
`config_dir()` triggers a one-time relocation of the pre-move top-level
`~/.kirocrew` into `~/.kiro/crew` (implemented in `kiro_crew/home_migration.py`).

**The completion marker is authoritative.** Resolution is gated on
`~/.kiro/crew/.data-home-ready`: once it exists (written only after a verified
copy), the migration is done and the new home is authoritative — `config_dir()`
returns it and **never re-migrates**, even if a `~/.kirocrew` directory is
present alongside it. Because the migration force-deletes legacy and there is
no downgrade/rollback path (below), a legacy dir that reappears *after* the
marker can only be resurrection **debris** (stale files an old or legacy-pinned
process wrote back); it is never authoritative and is never copied over the new
home — doing so would revert same-named files (`sel_hmac.key`, logs,
`workspace/`) to stale versions. The debris is left in place and RETAINED for
manual cleanup — it stays under the credential-protected `.kirocrew`
sensitive-path prefix, but is NOT auto-removed (the leftover sweep only clears
`.kirocrew.archived` / `.kiro/crew.pre-migration`, never `.kirocrew` itself). A
legacy dir re-created later is likewise never promoted, so the recreate /
check-to-resolve race is benign. The conflicted state (marker + non-empty
legacy) is not silent: `config_dir()` logs a one-time WARNING and
`detect_data_home_conflict()` surfaces it in `kirocrew doctor`'s Data Home
section with a manual-cleanup hint. Migration therefore runs **only**
when the marker is absent (a genuine pre-move install whose legacy home is the
real data root).

It is **copy-then-verify-then-delete**: the legacy tree is copied directly into
the new home — OVERWRITING any file already present there under the same
relative path, so the legacy copy always wins over whatever pre-existed at
`~/.kiro/crew` (a partial prior migration, a dir a sibling Kiro tool created, or
a `KIROCREW_HOME=~/.kiro/crew` experiment), while a new-home-only entry with no
legacy counterpart is left untouched — every regular file is then verified
present at the destination, and only after that verification succeeds is
`~/.kirocrew` removed outright. **There is no rollback copy and no backup of
whatever the new home held before the overwrite** — once the move completes,
only `~/.kiro/crew` remains on disk. If the copy or verification fails,
`~/.kirocrew` is left fully intact for a retry on the next start. The move is
idempotent, skipped while a gateway is live on either home (the resolving
process JOINS whichever home the live gateway holds — legacy or new — so its
`.local_secret` matches the gateway's for internal IPC, rather than pinning to
the other home and failing every internal API call with 403; the completion
marker is NOT written on a liveness skip — it is reserved for a verified copy,
so a fail-safe `_gateway_is_live` OSError can't brand a partial home as
migrated — and the one-time copy simply completes on the next clean cold
start), and never runs when `KIROCREW_HOME` is set (dev/worktree homes are
not migrated). Before the copy starts it prints a one-line `migrating data
home …` notice to stderr so a slow first-run copy on a large home is not
mistaken for a hang.

**Read-only destination files are overwritten.** The copy passes a custom
`copy_function` (`_copy_overwrite`) instead of `shutil.copytree`'s default
`copy2`. When the new home is already populated (a partial prior migration, or
a directory a sibling Kiro tool created — the marker is ABSENT, so this is the
one-time first migration, NOT a re-migration; under the marker-authoritative
rule a marker-present home is never re-migrated), a same-path destination file
that is read-only would make `copy2`'s
truncate-open fail with `PermissionError`. This is not hypothetical: git writes
packfiles (`*.pack`/`*.idx`/`*.rev` under `.git/objects/pack`) mode `0o444`, and
app-source checkouts under the data home carry them, so an unguarded merge
reliably aborted on the first such file — leaving the user in a permanent
split-brain (legacy authoritative, new home half-populated, gateway pinned to
legacy). `_copy_overwrite` clears the destination's read-only state (adds the
owner-write bit, `st_mode | S_IWUSR`) before delegating to `copy2` (which then
copies the source's own mode bits over, restoring `0o444`), so legacy still wins
the overwrite as intended. The chmod is best-effort and only touches a path that
already exists at the destination — never the read-only source.

**Symlinks are skipped, not preserved.** The copy does not pass
`symlinks=True` to `shutil.copytree`, so any symlink in the legacy tree —
intra-home, pointing outside the home, or dangling — is skipped entirely
(matched by `_make_copy_ignore` alongside sockets/FIFOs/devices) rather than
followed or reproduced. This is a deliberate simplification: preserving
symlinks across a merge has real edge cases (a legacy symlink can't overwrite
a real file already at the destination; an absolute intra-home symlink would
dangle once legacy is deleted; a dangling symlink would abort the whole
`copytree` call if dereferenced), and the data home has no user-facing
symlinks worth carrying forward. The practical effect is limited to internal
convenience links a user or tool may have created inside the data home.

**Excluded bulk trees.** `_EXCLUDED_TOP_LEVEL_DIRS` (`models`, `cache`) are
large and regenerable, so they are never copied — carrying them forward would
make the first-run copy needlessly slow for no benefit. The new home simply
regenerates them on demand (the sha256-pinned GGUF embedding model re-downloads
over HTTPS on next start), exactly as a fresh install does. A same-named dir
NESTED under real data is not excluded (the match is anchored at the legacy
root).

**No rollback.** Because the legacy home is deleted (not archived) and any
pre-existing divergent `~/.kiro/crew` is overwritten (not backed up), there is no
supported downgrade path: a release older than this move knows nothing of
`~/.kiro/crew`, and after the migration completes there is nothing left under
`~/.kirocrew` to restore from. A user who needs to preserve the pre-move state
must back it up themselves (e.g. `cp -a ~/.kirocrew ~/.kirocrew.manual-backup`)
BEFORE upgrading.

**Leftover-archive cleanup (`_sweep_ungated_archive_leftovers`).** An EARLIER
release of this migration (already shipped on `main` before this no-retention
contract) could have left `~/.kirocrew.archived` (a full rollback copy) or
`~/.kiro/crew.pre-migration/<timestamp>` (a sidelined divergent-home backup) on
disk. Neither path is on the security keystone anymore (`_CREW_HOME_PREFIXES`
dropped `.kirocrew.archived`; the `.kiro/crew.pre-migration` entry was removed
outright — nothing creates them, so gating them was dead weight), which means a
leftover one from that earlier release is now UNGATED: its frozen credentials
would otherwise be agent-readable indefinitely with nothing to ever prompt a
cleanup. `config_dir()` therefore deletes either directory outright (matching
this migration's no-retention design — not just shredding the credential
leaves) on every default-path resolution. It never follows a symlink at either
root, is best-effort (a removal failure is logged and retried on the next
start, never blocks startup), and is a quiet no-op once both are gone.

**Repository-controlled uninstall contract.** Every uninstall path owned by this
repository preserves the KiroCrew data home by default. `kirocrew service
uninstall` removes only its service definition; the Python/npm packages define
no uninstall lifecycle hook; and the desktop shell's generated NSIS uninstaller
removes only its install directory and shortcuts (`deleteAppDataOnUninstall`
stays false), without
resolving or removing the KiroCrew home. App Kit uninstall also preserves the
app's `data/` subtree unless the dedicated `purge_data=true` API action (CLI
`--purge-data`, or an explicit dashboard choice) is supplied. The API checks
for the literal boolean `true`; absent, legacy, or malformed values fail closed
to preservation. A whole-home purge is never coupled to uninstall.

**Uninstaller consideration (external dependency).** Because the data home now
lives under `~/.kiro/`, a hypothetical Kiro-family uninstaller that removes
`~/.kiro/` would also remove `~/.kiro/crew` and take KiroCrew's data — config,
credentials, memory DB, session history, and the SEL audit chain — with it. This
is a persisted-data one-way door, and — unlike when an archived rollback copy
existed — there is now no `~/.kirocrew.archived` fallback for ANY install
(upgrader or fresh), so such a wipe is unrecoverable total data loss.

Any Kiro-family uninstaller spec **MUST** either explicitly exclude
`~/.kiro/crew` from a `~/.kiro/`-wide wipe, or prompt before deleting it.
Independently, a user who wants the data home entirely outside `~/.kiro/` can set
`KIROCREW_HOME` to relocate it.

**Technical hedge — recovery-pointer breadcrumb.** `config_dir()` writes a small,
non-secret `~/.kirocrew.breadcrumb` pointer file at the top-level home
(`RECOVERY_BREADCRUMB_NAME`), deliberately **outside** `~/.kiro/`, recording the
data-home path (see `_write_recovery_breadcrumb`). It is idempotent (rewritten
only when the recorded path changes), best-effort (never blocks startup), and
written only on the default path (a `KIROCREW_HOME` override carries no `~/.kiro/`
wipe risk). It is **not a backup** — just a durable signpost that survives a
`~/.kiro/`-wide uninstaller wipe so a user or support script can find any
surviving data or understand what was removed. This narrows, but does not
eliminate, the one-way-door risk above; the release gate still stands.

**Paths are resolved per call, never captured at import.** Because
`config_dir()` re-reads `$KIROCREW_HOME` on every call and the migration above
is deliberately lazy, the resolved value is only correct at the moment it is
needed. Modules therefore MUST NOT bind a path factory result to a module-level
constant:

```python
_SOME_DIR = config_dir() / "some"        # WRONG -- frozen at import
```

An import-time binding captures whatever home was active when the module was
first imported, which breaks three things at once: pod isolation (a pod exports
its own `KIROCREW_HOME`), the one-time legacy-home migration (resolved after
import), and test isolation — `conftest.py`'s autouse `_isolate_kirocrew_home`
fixture runs *after* collection has already imported the module under test, so
it cannot reach a frozen constant. That last hole let a local test run write
2128 fixture rows into an operator's real usage store.

The required shape keeps the module-level name as an explicit opt-in override
(`None` = resolve live), so existing `monkeypatch.setattr(mod, "_SOME_DIR", tmp)`
call sites keep working:

```python
_SOME_DIR: Path | None = None

def _some_dir() -> Path:
    return _SOME_DIR if _SOME_DIR is not None else config_dir() / "some"
```

Annotating the override as `Path | None` is load-bearing: any consumer that
still reads the constant directly becomes a **mypy error** rather than a silent
`None` at runtime. This is enforced repo-wide by
`test/test_lazy_data_home_paths.py`, which walks the AST of `src/kiro_crew` for
module-level assignments calling any factory declared in `config/paths.py` and
fails on every hit. The factory list is derived from `paths.py` itself, so a
newly added factory is covered without editing the test. Issue #874.

**`config_dir()` maintains; `data_home()` only resolves.** `config_dir()` is
*resolve + maintain*: besides resolving the home it `mkdir`s it, refreshes the
`~/.kiro-crew-location` recovery breadcrumb (a stat + a read) and re-runs
`_sweep_ungated_archive_leftovers()`, which can `shutil.rmtree` a leftover
archive from an earlier release. That work belongs to process start —
`ensure_data_home()` is the startup hook — and the distinction did not matter
while callers froze the result in a module constant, because the maintenance
then ran exactly once, at import.

Resolving per call makes it load-bearing: a request handler would otherwise
perform a destructive sweep **on the event loop** as a side effect of asking
where a directory is. So the accessors above call **`data_home()`**:

| branch | behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| a **valid** `KIROCREW_HOME` override | delegates to `config_dir()` every call, so an override set *after* import is honoured. That branch performs neither the breadcrumb refresh nor the sweep — only a cheap `mkdir`. |
| default home already resolved | returns the cached `_resolved_home` directly — no `mkdir`, no breadcrumb, no sweep. |
| not yet resolved | delegates to `config_dir()`, so the **first** resolution in a process still migrates, creates the home and sweeps once. |

The first row tests `_valid_override_home()` — the **same predicate `config_dir()`
gates on**, not merely "is the env var set". An override naming a system
directory (`/`, `/usr`, …) is rejected there and resolution falls through to the
default home, so gating on the raw env var would send every call down the
maintenance path and put the destructive sweep back on the request path for
anyone with a bad override. The two predicates must not drift apart; a regression
test pins both directions.

That last row is what keeps the sweep's documented contract intact: it specifies
"a leftover created between two starts … is still caught on the **next start**".
The sweep is specified per *start*; running it per *call* was the mechanism, not
the requirement. `data_home()` keeps no cache of its own — the override branch
must stay live, and the cached branch reads the same `_resolved_home` that
`config_dir()` populates, so there is one source of truth for the location.

Existing direct `config_dir()` callers are unchanged and keep the maintenance
behaviour, including 25 pre-existing calls that already sit inside async
handlers.

## Workspace Root

`workspace_root()` returns the base directory for all LLM working directories (kiro-cli cwd, task runner output, etc.):

Resolution order:
1. `KIROCREW_WORKSPACE` env var — used as-is (no `kirocrew-workspace` subdirectory appended)
2. Saved path in `~/.kiro/crew/workspace_dir` (written by `kirocrew setup`; re-running setup preserves the existing value as the prompt default)
3. Platform default:

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| macOS | `/Volumes/workplace/kirocrew-workspace` (falls back to `~/workplace/kirocrew-workspace` if `/Volumes/workplace` doesn't exist) |
| Linux | `~/workplace/kirocrew-workspace` |

Each session/task gets an isolated subdirectory under this root via `_session_work_dir(key)`:
- Chat sessions: `kirocrew-workspace/cli_chat`, `kirocrew-workspace/{thread_ts}`
- Background: `kirocrew-workspace/_bg`
- Cron: `kirocrew-workspace/cron_{job_id}`
- TaskRunner: `kirocrew-workspace/taskrunner_main`
- Background session: `kirocrew-workspace/_bg`

The parent directory is created on first call if it doesn't exist.

## Project Directory Resolution

`KIROCREW_PROJECT_DIR` env var controls where agent config and skills are loaded from:

1. Env var `KIROCREW_PROJECT_DIR` (if set and valid)
2. CWD walk-up — CLI walks up from CWD looking for `skills/` + `src/kiro_crew/` (the `agents/` dir was removed in commit bbbc1f6e when agent config moved into `src/kiro_crew/config/`)
3. Saved path in `~/.kiro/crew/project_dir` (written by `kirocrew setup`)
4. Bundled fallback — `config/defaults.json` and `builtin_skills/` inside the package

The CLI (`cli.py:main()`) auto-detects and sets the env var at startup.

## Config Overlay (config.local.json)

User overrides can be placed in `~/.kiro/crew/config.local.json`. This file is
deep-merged on top of `config.json` at load time and is never touched by
`kirocrew setup` or package upgrades.

Resolution order:
1. Load `config.json` (managed by KiroCrew, may be regenerated on upgrade)
2. Deep-merge `config.local.json` on top (user-owned, never touched by setup/migration)
3. Return merged result

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Save a setting to config.local.json (persists across upgrades):
kirocrew config set --local agent.yolo true

# Save to config.json (may be overwritten on upgrade):
kirocrew config set agent.yolo true
```

### `config_local_path() -> Path`
Returns `~/.kiro/crew/config.local.json` (or `$KIROCREW_HOME/config.local.json`).

### `_deep_merge(base: dict, overlay: dict) -> dict`
Recursively merges overlay into base. Dict values merge recursively; all other
types in overlay replace base values.

## APIs

### `KiroCrewConfig.load() -> KiroCrewConfig`
Loads config from disk. Merges `config.local.json` overlay if present.
Returns defaults if file is missing or invalid.

**Hot-path cache.** `load()` is called per message / per request on several hot
paths. The expensive work — reading `config.json` (+ `config.local.json`),
`json.loads`, `_deep_merge`, and the full `jsonschema.validate` — is cached as
the validated, merged `data` dict, keyed on a fingerprint of both files
(`st_mtime_ns`, `st_size`, `st_mode`). On a cache hit, `load()` still builds
**fresh dataclasses from a deep copy**, so the many callers that mutate the
returned config in place (settings handlers, the write-back migration) never
corrupt the shared cache. The cache is mtime-keyed (not a blind TTL), so a
runtime edit is reflected on the next `load()`; `save()` also invalidates it
eagerly via `_invalidate_config_cache()`. The defaults-only path (neither file
present) is not cached.

### `KiroCrewConfig._resolve_agent_model() -> str`
Reads model from installed agent config (`~/.kiro/agents/kirocrew.json`),
falling back to the bundled `config_package_dir()/defaults.json` (i.e.
`src/kiro_crew/config/defaults.json`), then `DEFAULT_MODEL`.

### `KiroCrewConfig._resolve_named_agent_model(agent, agents_dir=None) -> str`
Returns a named agent's own kiro `model` field, or `""` if none. Used by
`SessionManager.get_or_create` so an explicit global `agent.model` ranks *below*
a per-agent model pin (per-agent pin > global default). Reads only the kiro
`model` slot. `agents_dir` is a dependency-injection seam for tests; defaults to
`kiro_agents_dir()`.

### `kiro_agents_dir() -> Path` (`config/paths.py`)
Leaf helper returning `~/.kiro/agents` — the **user-level** scope. Lives in the leaf
module so `loader.py` (and `_resolve_named_agent_model`'s `agents_dir` DI seam) can
locate installed agent JSONs without importing `kiro_crew.agent` — which imports
`config.loader` and would create an import cycle.

Deliberately **single-valued**: it is the WRITE target as well as a read scope
(`bridges._register_agents` and `agent.rebuild_agent_config` both write here), so it
is never widened into a search path.

### `project_agents_dir(project_dir)` / `project_kiro_dir(project_dir)` (`config/paths.py`)
The **project** scope, read-only: `<project>/.kiro/agents` (kiro-cli's own workspace
agents dir) and `<project>/.kiro` (which holds Kiro Crew's older
`*.agent-spec.json` convention). kiro-cli resolves `--agent` against
`$PWD/.kiro/agents` before the user-level dir with **no upward walk**, and Kiro Crew
spawns kiro-cli with the session's project directory as its cwd, so this is exactly
the directory the backend searches for that session.

Only `.kiro/agents/*.json` is **dispatchable**: kiro-cli does not read
`*.agent-spec.json`, so `agent_discovery.project_agent_files()` excludes it unless
the caller opts in with `include_legacy=True` (only the Slack handler does, for its
own pre-existing listing/resolution). Offering a legacy-only name on a dispatch
surface would have it accepted by the picker and by `spawn_run`, then fail at
`session/set_mode`.

### `resolve_agent_bindings(config, agent_name=None, project_dir=None) -> ResolvedBindings`
Resolves the workspace, memory store and **kiro agent** a session runs under.
Resolution order:

1. `agent_name` is a key in `config.agents` — use that alias's bindings.
2. `agent_name` is a **materialized kiro agent config** — a `*.json` under
   `~/.kiro/agents/` or, when `project_dir` is given, under
   `<project>/.kiro/agents/` — whose **declared `name`** matches (the filename stem
   only when the config declares no name) — take the *default* alias's
   workspace/memory bindings but dispatch **that agent itself**. `kiro-cli agent
   list` enumerates agents by declared name, so a namespaced filename stem such as
   `mochi--mochi` is NOT a name kiro-cli can resolve and must not be treated as
   dispatchable.
3. otherwise `config.default_agent`, then the first available alias, then bare
   defaults.

Rung 2 exists because an app's agents are materialized into `~/.kiro/agents/` by
`bridges._register_agents` under a namespaced FILENAME (`<app>--<agent>.json`)
while the config inside keeps the app's own bare `name`, and **nothing adds them
to `config.agents`** — that mapping is authored by setup / the user. Without it an
app-bound session fell through to `default_agent` and the DEFAULT agent answered
while the slot still advertised the requested name, with none of the app's MCP
tools. The rung is deliberately wider than app agents: **any** parseable config in
those directories dispatches with default bindings, because they *are* the
kiro-cli agent registry and narrowing to app-registered names would require
provenance they do not record.

`project_dir` must be the directory the session actually runs in (the same value
passed as the kiro-cli cwd).

**Neither scope touches the filesystem on the event loop.** The user-level scope is
served from the process-wide materialized snapshot (refreshed off-loop by the
writer); the project scope differs per session, so it is served by
`agent_discovery.project_agent_names()` — a per-project name set revalidated by a
stat-only signature, so a repeat scan costs two `scandir` walks rather than
re-reading every spec. `_project_declares_agent` splits on whether a loop is running:
off-loop it scans, on-loop it reads `cached_project_agent_names()`, which performs
**no syscalls at all** and reports "not declared" on a cold cache so the caller falls
back — exactly as the cold-snapshot user-level path does. Bounding the file *count*
is not the same guarantee as bounding *latency*: this runs on every turn of a
project-bound session, so a network or otherwise slow checkout would become a
recurring gateway stall the loop-stall watchdog blames on chat.

Async callers therefore **warm the cache before resolving**:
`agent_discovery.warm_project_agent_names()` runs the scan on
`executors.discovery_executor()` (the pool `/api/agents/installed` uses), after which
the on-loop read is a hit. `chat_runner._run_chat` and the side-turn handler both do
this.

`subagent._validate_agent` cannot warm — `spawn()` is synchronous and already on the
loop — so it reads the project scope from `cached_project_agent_names()` only. A
project agent is accepted once that project's cache is warm (any session that
resolved bindings for it has warmed it); a cold cache reports the name unknown, which
is fail-closed and matches that function's existing rule of refusing an unknown name
rather than silently running the default. Widening its pre-existing user-level scan to
a second directory instead would stall the gateway.

`slack/handler._resolve_agent_name` runs on the loop too, so it prefilters on the
**filename** and reads at most the one matching spec — resolving every spec's declared
name would stall Slack on a checkout with many agents.

**Only the warm is offloaded — never `resolve_agent_bindings` itself.** The resolver
can raise `StopIteration` (its defensive `next(iter(config.agents))` branch on a
malformed config), and `StopIteration` cannot be delivered through a `Future`:
asyncio rejects it, so an awaiting caller hangs instead of seeing the error, and the
`except Exception` that callers rely on never runs. Keeping resolution synchronous
preserves its exception contract for every call site.

`ResolvedBindings` additionally reports `requested_resolved` (whether the
requested name was honored — False means the default answered) and
`resolved_alias` (the alias key whose bindings were used). Callers that store a
name must store `resolved_alias`, never `kiro_agent`: the stored value is
re-resolved later with aliases matched FIRST, so a physical agent name that also
happens to be an alias key would dispatch that alias's target instead.

### Materialized-agent snapshot (`config/loader.py`)
Rung 2's membership test is a process-global `frozenset` — a pure in-memory lookup
with **no filesystem I/O, not even a stat**. It is reached on every turn of an
app-bound session from the gateway event loop (`_run_chat` →
`resolve_agent_bindings`), where a directory scan would stall chat, WebSocket and
heartbeat processing (`no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`).

The snapshot is only ever rebuilt off-loop:

- `refresh_materialized_agents()` — full rescan; **must** run off-loop. Reads each
  config through `hooks.safe_read_file`, so a symlink planted in that
  user-writable directory cannot make a boot refresh read a protected file;
  refused paths are skipped. A stem is trusted only after the file parses as a
  JSON object.
- `schedule_materialized_agents_refresh()` — safe from anywhere: offloads to the
  default executor when a loop is running, refreshes inline when not.
- `publish_materialized_agents(names)` — pure set union, no I/O, so it is safe on
  the loop. `_register_agents` publishes what it just wrote **before** scheduling
  the rescan, so a slot created before the rescan lands still resolves.
- `_register_agents` / `_deregister_agents` schedule a rescan around their writes
  (unconditionally on the register side: a call that writes nothing may follow a
  prune, and only a rescan drops a name that is gone from disk).

Two guards keep concurrent updates coherent, each with a test that fails when it
is disabled: a **generation counter** bumped by every publish (a scan that globbed
before a write unions rather than replacing, so it cannot erase a just-published
name), and a **monotonic ticket** taken when a refresh starts (a completed scan is
discarded if a refresh that started later already applied, so an older view
finishing second cannot resurrect a deleted agent). A lookup with no snapshot yet
builds one lazily **only** in a synchronous context; on a running loop it falls
back for that turn rather than block.

Known follow-up (#1429): the snapshot makes this module a second home for agent
discovery beside `apps/registry`, and `_resolve_named_agent_model` below still
reads that directory without the sensitive-path gate.

### `KiroCrewConfig.create_provider_factory() -> Callable`
Returns a factory for LLMProvider instances. Resolves `"auto"` model
before creating the provider.

### `KiroCrewConfig.to_dict() -> dict`
Serializes config to the JSON structure used by `config.json`. Uses `_configured_port`
(the file value) instead of `dashboard_port` (which may be overridden by `KIROCREW_PORT`
env var) to avoid clobbering the saved port on write-back.

### `KiroCrewConfig.save() -> None`
Writes current config to `~/.kiro/crew/config.json` via `to_dict()`, through
`write_config_atomically()` (see below). Invalidates the `load()` validated-data
cache so the next load reflects the write immediately.

### Partial config updates: `read_config_for_update()` / `write_config_atomically()`

Many callers do not hold a whole `KiroCrewConfig` — they flip one toggle
(`auto_update`), persist one channel, or seed one default. That shape is a
**read the whole file → mutate one key → write it all back** cycle, and both
halves of it are data-loss-prone. These two helpers are the required primitives
for it; do not hand-roll the cycle.

**`read_config_for_update(path=None) -> dict` fails CLOSED.** The natural
`try: json.loads(...) except Exception: data = {}` is a bug in this shape,
because the `{}` fallback is indistinguishable from "the user has no settings" —
so the write-back replaces a fully populated config with a single-key one, every
setting the user ever chose is gone, and the endpoint still reports success. So:
an **absent** file returns `{}` (a genuine empty starting point), while an
unreadable or non-JSON-object file raises **`ConfigReadError`**. Callers must let
that abort the update; leaving the existing file untouched always beats
overwriting it with defaults. `ConfigReadError` deliberately does **not** inherit
from `OSError`/`ValueError`, so a pre-existing broad `except OSError` around the
write cannot swallow it and resume the clobbering path.

The read fails for mundane reasons, most commonly a **torn read**: a
truncate-then-write config writer leaves a window in which a concurrent reader
observes a half-written file. The window is small, which is exactly what made the
resulting loss so hard to reproduce — it presented as "all my settings reset
themselves".

**`write_config_atomically(path, data, *, fsync=False)` is atomic AND
mode-preserving.** Atomic (tmp+rename) so no reader ever sees a partial file —
this is what closes the torn-read window for everyone else. Mode-preserving
because tmp+rename creates a NEW inode, so the umask default (typically `0644`)
would silently replace an operator's tightened `0600`; `config.json` can hold
inline credentials, so a settings write must never widen who can read it. An
existing file's mode carries over and a newly created one is owner-only. It
deliberately does NOT call `platform_compat.restrict_to_owner`: that helper shells
out to `icacls` on Windows, and this function runs inside async request handlers
and `save()`, so calling it would put a blocking subprocess on the gateway event
loop (`no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`). Omitting it is no worse than the
truncate-then-write it replaced, which applied no DACL either.

**Mode preservation is POSIX-only.** `atomic_write`'s `mode` routes through
`fchmod_safe`, a documented no-op on Windows, where access is carried by the DACL
instead. Applying one would mean an `icacls` subprocess, which this function must
not run (above) — so on Windows the replacement file inherits the directory's ACL,
exactly as the `write_text` it replaced did. The three mode/symlink tests in
`test_config_rmw_preserves_settings.py` are `skipif(not IS_POSIX)` for this reason;
the data-loss and AST-guard tests are platform-independent and run everywhere.

**Symlinks are followed, not replaced.** `os.replace` renames over the link
itself, so a symlinked `config.json` would become a regular file and its target
would go stale — the `write_text` this replaced followed the link. The target is
resolved before the stat and the write, so symlinking the config into a dotfiles
repo keeps working.

**Atomicity is not serialization.** `write_config_atomically()` guarantees a
reader never sees a partial file; it does NOT serialize a read-modify-write
against another process. Two writers that interleave (the CLI and the gateway,
say) are still last-writer-wins per key, since each read its own snapshot before
mutating. In-process dashboard handlers additionally take `_get_config_lock()`,
which serializes them against each other but not against a separate process.

One deliberate exception: the interactive `kirocrew config set --local` path
overwrites a corrupt `config.local.json` rather than failing closed — the user
typed an explicit command and sees the result on stdout. Pinned by
`test_config_overlay.py::TestCliConfigSetLocal`.

### `config_dir() -> Path`
Returns `~/.kiro/crew/` (nested under kiro-cli's `~/.kiro/` base). Overridden by
`KIROCREW_HOME` env var (refuses system directories like `/`, `/usr`, `/System`,
`/etc`). On the default (non-override) path, a pre-move `~/.kirocrew` is migrated
once into `~/.kiro/crew` — see "Data Home Location & Migration" above.

### `config_path() -> Path`
Returns `~/.kiro/crew/config.json` (or `$KIROCREW_HOME/config.json` if overridden).

### Agent Bookkeeping Sidecar (`agent_model_state.json`)

KiroCrew tracks two pieces of per-agent state that are **not** part of the
kiro-cli agent schema: `model_managed` (whether an agent's `model` tracks the
shipped default or is a frozen user pick) and `cc_model` (a per-agent Claude
Code model). kiro-cli validates `~/.kiro/agents/*.json` with serde
`deny_unknown_fields` and rejects the *entire* spec on any unknown key, then
silently falls back to the default agent (`--agent <name>` resolves to default
with only a stderr "no agent with name X found" line). To keep every spec
schema-valid, this state lives in a KiroCrew-owned sidecar
`~/.kiro/crew/agent_model_state.json` (honoring `KIROCREW_HOME`), keyed by agent
name:

```json
{
  "kirocrew":           {"model_managed": true},
  "kirocrew-heartbeat": {"cc_model": "claude-sonnet-4.6"}
}
```

- Read/written via `kiro_crew/agent_state.py` (atomic, lock-guarded near-leaf
  module: stdlib + `config.paths` + `atomic_write` only).
- `build_agent_config()` is pure (writes no spec key); `rebuild_agent_config()`
  seeds managed-state on a fresh/clean install (never clobbering a frozen pick).
- `_refresh_dynamic_fields()` sources managed-state from the sidecar and strips
  any stray `model_managed`/`cc_model` from the spec (steady-state self-heal).
  A **managed** spec's `model` is set on every refresh to the shipped default,
  or to the `"auto"` sentinel when the shipped template pins none — never left
  as-is. That is what makes the global `agent.model` reversible: the global is
  propagated into the spec when it is a concrete pick, and because a spec pin
  outranks the global in `resolve_effective_model`, returning the global to
  `"auto"` must take the pin back off or `"auto"` is unreachable from the
  configuration surface. Ownership decides who may clear: `model_managed=false`
  (an explicit user pick) and an **absent** sidecar entry (legacy status, owner
  unknown) both keep their pin untouched.
- `migrate_agent_specs()` runs at startup (top of `rebuild_agent_config`): lifts
  the keys out of every `~/.kiro/agents/*.json` into the sidecar and removes
  them (idempotent), fixing installs polluted by older builds.
- The dashboard model PATCH writes the sidecar, never the spec; agent DELETE
  prunes the sidecar entry.

Note: KiroCrew is KiroACP (kiro-cli) only — the deleted `claude_code` provider
was the sole reader of spec `cc_model`, so `cc_model` is now dead config. The
lite/heartbeat installers still write it to the sidecar (harmless bookkeeping)
purely to keep the kiro spec schema-clean; nothing in the fork resolves it.

**Invariant:** `~/.kiro/agents/*.json` must contain only kiro-cli schema keys at
all times — after install, refresh, and any dashboard edit — or kiro-cli drops
the agent and silently falls back to default.

### Computer use: no `enabled` field here

`ComputerUseConfig` carries display and limits only. The switch for native desktop
GUI automation lives **outside `config.json`**, on the keystone at
`~/.kiro/crew/computer_use.json` (path via `config.loader.computer_use_state_path()`,
leaf on `security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`):

```json
{
  "enabled": false,
  "allowed_apps": [],
  "extra_denied_apps": []
}
```

The absence is deliberate and the precedent is `denied_commands.json`:
`is_sensitive_write_path("~/.kiro/crew/config.json")` is `True` (the *tool* path is
protected), but `is_sensitive_bash_command("echo x > ~/.kiro/crew/config.json")` is
`None` — `_WRITE_PROTECTED_BASH_LEAVES` is `('.data-home-ready',)` only. A config
toggle would therefore be flippable by a prompt-injected agent through any shell
redirect.

- **`enabled`** — the primary enable for full desktop observation plus input
  synthesis. A security ceiling, so it goes where the agent can neither read nor
  write it. Read with a strict `is True` identity test, so a truthy string such as
  `"enabled": "false"` does **not** enable desktop control, and the read fails soft
  to `{}` → **off**.
- **`allowed_apps` / `extra_denied_apps`** — the operator's own narrowing. These
  are the ONLY other keys `PolicyConfig.from_state` reads.

**There is no `allow_pointer_move` key, and writing one has no effect.** An earlier
revision documented it here as a second consent switch for `click_method: "global"`
(the one path that warps the real mouse pointer), gated together with a
`capabilities.computer_use_pointer` governance row. Both were removed by product
decision: there are no `computer_use.*` governance scopes at all, and
`from_state` reads only the three keys above, so a hand-written
`{"enabled": true, "allow_pointer_move": false}` silently grants the pointer path —
the operator would believe they had withheld consent. What actually contains that
path is that the model must NAME the method (`auto` never resolves onto it) and every
use is SEL-audited under its own `tool_kind`. Do not re-document the flag without
re-implementing it. See [security.md](security.md), [governance.md](governance.md)
and [computer-use.md](computer-use.md).

#### `computer_use.cursor_motion` — the one new `config.json` flag

Cursor Motion (the cosmetic fake-cursor desktop overlay) is the exception that
proves the rule above: it belongs in `config.json` precisely *because* it grants no
capability. `computer_use.cursor_motion` is a **display preference, default OFF** —
the overlay draws an image, never moves the pointer, cannot deliver input, and is
invisible to `screencapture`, so an agent flipping it could at most decorate its own
clicks. A keystone flag would imply a security decision that does not exist.

`overlay.cursor_motion_enabled()` reads it through `getattr(section,
"cursor_motion", False)` **even though the field is now declared** on
`ComputerUseConfig`, and that stays deliberate: it makes the read
**forward-compatible and fail-OFF**: a build whose `ComputerUseConfig` predates the
field resolves to OFF rather than raising inside a tool call, and a missing field can
only ever mean "no decoration", never "start drawing on the user's screen".

Three consequences for this module: `"computer_use"` MUST be present in
`_KNOWN_CONFIG_SECTIONS` (the guarded invariant that `to_dict()`'s emitted sections
equal that set); the dashboard's `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` exposes only the limits
(`computer_use.max_tree_nodes`, `computer_use.screenshot_max_px`) — never an
`enabled` key; and every numeric knob is clamped to
the same `*_LIMIT` ceiling the MCP tool schemas enforce, so a hand-edited
`config.json` cannot ask for an unbounded accessibility walk or a full-resolution
screenshot.

### Security-Bounded Config Clamp

Resource-limit and timeout knobs are clamped to hard ceilings **at load time**, not
just at the dashboard write gate. The ceilings are the single source of truth in
`loader.py`:

| Constant | Value | Field |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `SUBAGENT_AUTO_MAX_CEILING` | 64 | `agent.subagent_auto_max`, `agent.max_subagents` |
| `SUBAGENT_MAX_TURNS_CEILING` | 200 | `agent.subagent_max_turns` |
| `POOL_SIZE_MAX` | 10 | `session.pool_size` |
| `CHAT_TURN_TIMEOUT_MIN` / `_MAX` | 300 / 7200 | `agent.chat_turn_timeout_secs` |
| `TOOL_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MIN` / `_MAX` | 30 / 7200 | `agent.tool_approval_timeout_secs` |

`_SECURITY_BOUNDED_FIELDS` lists each `(section, key, min, max)`; the mins match
the existing runtime floors (0/1) so a legitimate in-range value is never
altered. `_clamp_security_bounds(data)` runs **once on the disk-read (cache-miss)
path, before the validated dict is cached** — so subsequent cache hits already
serve clamped values. It clamps out-of-range real integers in place (a JSON
`true`/`false` bool or any non-int is skipped and left to dataclass
coercion/defaults), logs a WARNING, and emits a best-effort `config_bounds_clamped`
SEL security event (never fatal — config loading must not raise).

Two **cross-field** clamps run after that generic pass, so both operands are
already in range:

- `agent.max_subagents`: 0 is the auto-size sentinel, so an explicit pin below
  `MAX_SUBAGENTS_FIXED_FLOOR` (3) is raised UP to the floor.
- `agent.tool_approval_timeout_secs` is pulled to `APPROVAL_TURN_MARGIN_SECS`
  (60) below `agent.chat_turn_timeout_secs`. An approval window that reaches the
  turn ceiling can never fire: the turn is cut first and reports itself as a turn
  timeout, so the unanswered approval is never named and an unattended run burns
  the whole ceiling on every prompt. `dashboard/turn_dispatch.py`
  `tool_approval_timeout_secs()` repeats the cap against the **resolved** ceiling,
  which the ACP prompt timeout can lower below the configured one, and then
  against the budget REMAINING in the running turn (`_TURN_DEADLINE`, published by
  `_bounded_turn`). The arm-time bound is the one that makes the invariant hold
  for a prompt arming late in a long turn; with under a margin left it returns
  `0.0` and the runner declines without waiting.

Why load-time (not just the API): the REST API rejects out-of-range writes, but a
direct edit of `config.json` (any process running as the same OS user — including
a prompt-injected agent with file-write access) bypassed that gate entirely. Each
knob controls a resource-consumption dimension (concurrent subagent processes,
per-subagent turn budget, pre-warmed pool processes), so an inflated on-disk value
could exhaust host memory/CPU/the process table (DoS). The dashboard write gate
(`dashboard/handlers/core.py`) and the runtime pool cap **import these same
constants**, so write-gate / load-clamp / runtime-cap cannot drift apart —
closing the direct-config-edit DoS gap.

### Dashboard theme persistence

`DashboardConfig.theme_mode` / `theme_color` / `onboarded` are workspace-persistent
(shared across ports and devices) rather than browser-local. The frontend reads
them at boot via `GET /api/theme/boot`; empty `theme_mode`/`theme_color` mean
unset (the frontend falls back to `localStorage` or the built-in default).

### Dashboard UI language

`DashboardConfig.language` selects the dashboard interface language. It rides the
same two endpoints as the theme fields — surfaced by `GET /api/theme/boot`
(unauthenticated, so the SPA can pick a language before the token flow completes
and avoid an English flash) and written by `PUT /api/config/theme`
(`{"language": "<tag>"}`). Both responses are built by one helper
(`handlers/core.py::_theme_payload`), so every read site returns the same shape.

Resolution precedence, implemented in `website/src/i18n/detect.ts`:

1. this config value (mirrored into `localStorage['mc-lang']` for a synchronous
   first paint),
2. the browser's `navigator.languages`, matched exact-then-primary-subtag
   (so `zh`/`zh-Hans` resolve to `zh-CN`),
3. `en`.

`""` is a first-class value meaning **auto-detect**, not "missing" — the picker's
Auto option writes `""` to clear a previous explicit choice. An explicit choice
always outranks detection, so a user who selects English on a zh-CN machine is
not re-detected back to Chinese on the next load.

The picker's Auto row is labelled plain **"Auto"**, not "Auto (follow browser)".
The desktop app has no browser preference to follow — its locale comes from the
OS — so naming the browser was wrong on that surface. The row annotates itself
with the language Auto actually resolves to ("Auto — Deutsch"), which answers the
question accurately on every surface.

The backend's **write path** validates **shape only** (`_LANGUAGE_TAG_RE`, a
conservative BCP-47 subset), not membership in the set of shipped catalogs — a
well-formed tag with no catalog stays writable and falls back to detection
client-side. The **agent-injection read path** additionally requires catalog
membership: `context.ui_language_tag()` checks the tag against
`context._UI_LANGUAGE_CATALOGS` (a mirror of the non-dev-only
`SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` entries) and treats a non-catalog tag exactly like
`""`/Auto — no `[UI LANGUAGE]` steer is emitted, so the agent is never steered
to a language the chrome cannot render (#1130). Adding a language is therefore
the three frontend edits — add `locales/<tag>.json`, register the picker entry
in `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`, and add the static import plus `AUTHORED_CATALOGS`
entry in `i18n/index.ts` — **plus one mechanical backend entry** in
`_UI_LANGUAGE_CATALOGS`, which the drift gate in
`test/test_context_ui_language.py` names explicitly on failure.

Shipped catalogs (ordered by global speaker count, which is also the picker
order): `en`, `zh-CN`, `hi`, `es`, `fr`, `bn`, `pt`, `ru`, `de`, `ja`, `ko`, `it`. Right-to-left
languages are deliberately **not** shipped yet: the catalogs would translate
fine, but the dashboard's layout uses physical-direction utilities (`pl-*`,
`left-*`, `text-left`) and unmirrored directional icons, so an RTL locale would
render correct text in a visibly wrong shell. RTL requires `dir="rtl"` plus a
logical-property conversion first.

All catalogs are **statically bundled**, so `t()` stays synchronous (see the
rationale in `website/src/i18n/index.ts`). The cost is that every user downloads
every language: at 8592 keys the catalogs share one chunk that is **~173 KB gzip
per catalog, ~2.0 MB gzip for the twelve combined** (`npm run analyze`, then gzip
the `assets/t-*.js` chunk). This is tolerable only because the dashboard is served
from a loopback gateway — over a network it is already past the point of
justification, and each further catalog adds another ~173 KB to every user's first
load regardless of the language they read.

The documented next step is therefore to keep `en` static and lazily fetch the
active non-English catalog. That seam is already isolated to
`website/src/i18n/index.ts` plus a `<Suspense>` boundary in `main.tsx`; no call
site changes. **Catalog #13 belongs behind that seam**: Korean is #12 and the last
one this chunk absorbs in front of it. Re-measure when the seam lands — the figure
above is what says whether it worked.

#### The tag reaches the agent, too

`context.py::_build_ui_language_section` injects the configured tag — after the
catalog-membership gate described above — into session
context as a `[UI LANGUAGE] <tag>` block (next to `[CURRENT AGENT]`/`[RUNTIME]`,
and in `minimal_context` mode as well). It exists for one string: the tool-call
purpose (`__tool_use_purpose`), which the dashboard paints as the tool-call pill
label and the messaging renderers reuse as the task title. That is the only piece
of model-generated prose rendered as *chrome*, and without the block the model
has nothing to go on and mirrors the language the user typed in — an inferred
signal that flips mid-session the moment the user pastes an English stack trace,
and one that persists, since purposes are stored in session history.

Reading it back off the wire matches by **shape**, not by a list of literals.
kiro-cli injects the `__tool_use_purpose` property into every tool schema it
exposes, and echoes it back in `rawInput` as either that name or a camelCased
`__toolUsePurpose` — but nothing validates the key, and the model paraphrases
it: `__purpose`, `__thinking_purpose` and `__woohoo_purpose` all appear in real
transcripts. `acp/_dispatch.py::extract_tool_purpose` prefers the canonical
spellings in `acp/types.py::TOOL_PURPOSE_KEYS`, then accepts any *reserved*
(dunder-prefixed) key whose name ends in `purpose`
(`_dispatch.py::is_tool_purpose_key`), scanned in sorted order so the reading is
deterministic. It is the single reader for both transports; matching literals
drops the purpose for every paraphrased spelling, and the concise pill silently
falls back to the raw command line while the unrecognized key leaks into the
arguments view as if it were a real parameter. The dunder prefix is what keeps a
tool's own functional `purpose` argument out of the match.
`website/src/utils/toolPurpose.ts` is the frontend mirror, used by the
pending-approval preview and the Mochi approval bubble.

Three properties are load-bearing:

- **`""` injects nothing.** Auto is resolved client-side by `detect.ts`; the
  backend does not know the outcome, so there is no truthful value to inject and
  un-configured installs keep byte-identical context.
- **The raw tag is injected, not a display name.** A backend code→name table
  would be a second list to keep in sync with `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` and would
  degrade to the tag for anything missing from it regardless. Raw is not
  unchecked: the builder re-validates the shape (`_UI_LANGUAGE_TAG_RE`, a
  superset-safe local mirror of `_LANGUAGE_TAG_RE`) and drops anything that is
  not tag-shaped. `PUT /api/config/theme` is not the only way a value reaches
  the field — the loader coerces whatever the JSON holds into `str`, so a
  hand-edited `"language": null` arrives as the literal `"None"` — and a value
  that lands in the system prompt should not depend on its writer having
  validated it.
- **Scope is the purpose text only.** The block says so explicitly, because
  widening it would collide with the base prompt's rule to reply in the user's
  language.

It is best-effort steering with no enforcement path: nothing validates the
language a model actually emits.

#### The tag also names the session

Auto-titling (`dashboard/chat_title.py`) asks a background model for the session
name that renders in the chat sidebar, and that name is chrome by the same
argument as the tool-call purpose above: the date group headers, filter labels and
rename menu around it are all in the UI language, and the name is *persisted*, so
one written in the conversation's language leaves two languages on the row for
good. With no directive the model simply mirrors the language of the prompt it was
given — measured on `claude-haiku-4.5`, a fully Chinese conversation is named
"Chat Title Language Mismatch".

The tag reaches the titler through the **prompt**, not the `[UI LANGUAGE]` block:
titling runs on the shared `_bg` session, and that block scopes itself explicitly
to tool-call purpose text. `chat_title._ui_language()` resolves the same tag
through the shared `context.ui_language_tag()`, and `_build_title_prompt()`
interpolates a directive into the prompt's `{language}` slot — outside the
delimited transcript, so a message that quotes the directive cannot restate it.
`""` omits the slot entirely and the prompt stays byte-identical to the one
auto-language workspaces have always sent.

Two consequences fall out of naming in a non-latin script:

- **The prose guard needs a second ceiling.** `_looks_like_prose` rejects a reply
  that is a sentence rather than a name, and its word ceiling counts
  `str.split()` tokens — which is 1 for any length of Chinese, Japanese or Thai.
  `_TITLE_MAX_UNSPACED_CHARS` bounds those scripts by character instead, counting
  only unspaced-script characters so latin identifiers in a mixed title stay
  free, and the full-width terminators `。！？` are matched without the ASCII
  rule's trailing-whitespace requirement (those scripts do not space after
  punctuation). A short refusal with no terminator remains a documented false
  negative.
- **The reveal animation needs characters.** The sidebar types a new title in one
  word at a time; a single-token title skipped the animation entirely, so
  `_title_reveal_prefixes` steps unspaced scripts two characters at a time
  instead, landing in the same step count as an equivalent latin title.

`_clean_title` strips the full-width and CJK quote/period forms (`「」`, `“”`,
`。`) alongside the ASCII ones, since that is what a zh/ja reply wraps a name in.

### Foreign-agent import onboarding state

`DashboardConfig.import_onboarded` is a separate workspace-persistent gate from
`dashboard.onboarded`. The import gate controls the first-run foreign-agent
review; `onboarded` continues to control the existing theme/feature onboarding.
The import gate is evaluated first. Completing or skipping import sets only
`import_onboarded`; it does not silently complete the later onboarding.

For backward compatibility, a config that omits `dashboard.import_onboarded`
is migrated from `dashboard.onboarded`. An already-onboarded user therefore
starts with `import_onboarded=true` and retains legacy status past the new first-run
gate, while a new or not-yet-onboarded workspace sees import before the existing
onboarding. `GET /api/theme/boot` exposes the resolved `import_onboarded` boolean
alongside the existing non-secret theme boot fields.

The frontend also recognizes the older browser-only `mc-onboarded` marker when
no `mc-import-onboarded` marker exists. Before applying false server defaults,
it persists both onboarding flags through `PUT /api/config/theme`; an explicit
newer import marker remains a cache only and continues to yield to server state.

Foreign settings are never deep-merged into `config.json`. The importer applies
only its explicit non-security settings allowlist, preserves every existing
KiroCrew value on collision, and reports unsupported or secret-bearing source
settings without copying them. Foreign credentials, security policy,
approval/sandbox settings, agent/runtime state, hooks, and arbitrary unknown
config sections cannot enter configuration through this path.

### `ChannelConfig.from_dict(data: dict) -> ChannelConfig`
Parses a channel config entry from JSON. Invalid activation values fall back to `"mention"`.

### `KiroCrewConfig.channel_config(channel_id: str) -> ChannelConfig`
Returns the effective config for a channel:
1. Explicit entry in `slack_channels` → returned as-is
2. DM channel (`D`-prefix) → `ChannelConfig(activation=slack_dm_activation)`
3. Group/public channel (`C`/`G`-prefix) → `ChannelConfig(activation="mention")`

The `dashboard.url` field controls where the dashboard is reachable. From it, the system derives the port to bind on, the bind address (`0.0.0.0` for non-loopback hosts, `127.0.0.1` otherwise), and the allowed origins for CSRF/WebSocket checks. When omitted, defaults to `localhost:5476`.

A **malformed** `dashboard.url` (e.g. an unterminated IPv6 literal `http://[::1` or a non-numeric port `http://host:notaport`) does **not** abort startup: `parse_dashboard_url` degrades to the defaults (`""` host, port `5476`) and logs a warning, so a single typo in the config can never take the gateway down on boot. `KIROCREW_PORT` still overrides the port regardless.

Once the dashboard's TCP site is listening, the gateway **exports the
actually-bound port as `KIROCREW_BOUND_PORT`** into its own environment, so
every child it spawns (kiro-cli sessions and their MCP stdio servers) inherits
the truth instead of re-deriving a guess from `dashboard.url` — a portless URL
would otherwise collapse to the default port in the child even when the
gateway is bound elsewhere (including `--port auto`, where the OS assigns the
port and no config field ever names it). It is a **distinct variable from
`KIROCREW_PORT`** on purpose: `KIROCREW_PORT` means operator intent and is
persisted by `service_environment()` into unit files, while
`KIROCREW_BOUND_PORT` is ephemeral observed truth that must never be frozen
into persistent config. Clients read it via `port_resolution.resolve_client_port`,
one precedence step below the operator override.

## Model Resolution Chain

When `agent.model` is `"auto"` (default):

1. `~/.kiro/agents/kirocrew.json` → `model` field (installed agent config)
2. `config_package_dir()/defaults.json` → `model` field (bundled `src/kiro_crew/config/defaults.json`)
3. Falls back to `DEFAULT_MODEL` (passed through to provider)

## Error Handling

- Missing file → defaults
- Invalid JSON → defaults (warning logged)
- Missing fields → individual defaults
