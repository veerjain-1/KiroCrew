"""Distro-bootstrap coverage for the shell installers.

The published one-liner ``curl … cli.sh | sh`` must bring up a runnable gateway
on Ubuntu (apt, and the split ``python3-venv`` package), RHEL/CentOS 7 (yum,
Python 3.6 baseline), and RHEL/CentOS 8+/Amazon Linux (dnf). Before this
coverage existed cli.sh had ONLY a dnf branch, so Ubuntu and CentOS 7 hard-
failed at the "Python >=3.10 is required" gate, and no test ever entered the
Python-resolution block (the signing harness leaks the host ``python3``).

These tests run the real ``cli.sh`` under a fabricated ``PATH`` that contains NO
usable ``python3`` plus fake package managers, so the script is forced through
its distro-detection ladder. Each fake records that it ran; the assertion is
which manager cli.sh reached for on which distro. POSIX-only scripts, so the
suite skips on native Windows.
