Connect / list / detail / labels stay a pure ``gh`` CLI + local-cache path (the
same "deterministic backbone" principle as code_review_sage's repo-scan routes).
The single LLM-backed route is ``/issue-ai``: it computes an issue's triage
summary + suggested labels via one model call, cache-first (paid once per issue,
served instantly on re-open). ``/pull-ai`` does the same for a pull request,
summarizing its description + whole conversation + check state; its cache is keyed
by a fingerprint of those inputs, so a new comment or a flipped check earns a
fresh summary while an unchanged PR is never re-summarized. The two write routes (``/labels/apply``,
``/issue/state``) are the confirm half of the suggest->confirm loop and are gated
on the user's ``triage``/``push`` access; a read-only repo degrades to
suggest-only (writes 403).

#     actually have open stays current regardless: its detail poll writes fresh
#     check state back into the list cache — see apply_pr_checks_to_list_cache.)

# ── pull-request actions ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The write half of the PR pane: the actions a maintainer otherwise leaves the app
# to perform on the provider's own web UI — close/reopen, approve, comment, merge or
# arm auto-merge, cancel or retry CI. Each is available per-PR and, where the action
# is safe to repeat across many PRs, in BULK from the list.
#
# Four rules hold for every handler here:
#
# 1. **Merging is offered, and it cannot bypass a gate — because the APP checks too,
#    not because the provider is a sufficient backstop.** Branch protection —
#    required reviews, required checks, required conversation resolution — is
#    enforced by the PROVIDER on its own merge endpoint, and an unsatisfied PR comes
#    back 405. But that is true only for an ORDINARY user: a repository admin holding
#    bypass-branch-protection gets the merge honoured, so "the provider adjudicates"
#    stops being true exactly for the account that can do the most damage. That is why
#    ``_handle_pull_merge`` re-reads the PR and refuses anything outside
#    ``_MERGE_ALLOWED_STATES`` itself, and why the merge is pinned to the reviewed
#    ``head_sha``. See the note on that constant.
#    So the app offers both halves of the real
#    workflow: ``merge`` for a PR that is mergeable now, and ``auto_merge`` for one
#    that should land by itself once its checks pass. An earlier revision shipped
#    only the second, reasoning that a direct merge could land unreviewed code —
#    which, with the app-side gate above, it cannot; what that omission actually did
#    was leave a repo with NO branch rule (where auto-merge is unavailable) with no
#    merge path at all.
#    There is still deliberately no "override and merge": an override is a
#    governance decision recorded ON the provider (this repo does it with a reviewed
#    `/ai-review override` comment), and a button
#    that silently sheds a required check is the one thing the provider would NOT
#    adjudicate for us.
# 2. **Bulk is opt-in per action, not a generic loop.** ``_handle_pulls_bulk``
#    dispatches only the verbs in :data:`_BULK_PR_ACTIONS`. Merging is deliberately
#    NOT among them: a merge is irreversible, and 50 of them from one click is a
#    blast radius no confirmation makes reasonable. Arming auto-merge IS, because it
#    is reversible from the same bar and the provider still decides each one.
# 3. **Partial failure is reported, never swallowed** — same contract as
#    ``/labels/apply-bulk``: per-PR results, so one locked PR does not fail a batch
#    that otherwise applied, and the user is never told about a write that did not
#    happen.
# 4. **Every mutation is permission-gated and SEL-audited**, and drops the caches
#    the action invalidated so the pane cannot keep showing the pre-action state.

# Upper bound on a CI run id. Provider run ids are global monotonic sequences (much
# larger than a per-repo item number, so this is its own constant), and like every
# other number here it reaches a path segment in the provider argv — an unbounded int
# makes that segment arbitrarily long.
MAX_RUN_ID = 1_000_000_000_000

# The verbs the bulk endpoint accepts. Deliberately a fixed allowlist rather than
# "any action name": a generic fan-out would silently gain every future action,
# including ones whose blast radius makes a 50-PR batch a bad idea — which is
# exactly why ``merge`` is absent (see rule 2 above).
_BULK_PR_ACTIONS = ("close", "reopen", "approve", "comment", "auto_merge", "cancel_auto_merge")

# Upper bound on PRs in one bulk request. Each one is at least one provider call,
# and the whole batch runs inside a single HTTP request, so this bounds both the

    commit — it accepts one that is no longer the head, and whether the resulting stale

    pull request approvals"). Where that is off, an unchecked approval satisfies
    protection on code nobody read. So the app reads the head itself, exactly as

    ``event`` is ``approve`` / ``request_changes`` / ``comment``. Which of those a
    provider can honour differs — GitLab has no "request changes" verb — and the
    client refuses rather than approximating, so the error names the real
    limitation instead of recording a verdict the platform never stored.

    ``head_sha`` is REQUIRED, like ``/pull/merge``'s: a review is a verdict on a
    REVISION, and it rides to the provider as GitHub's ``commit_id`` / GitLab's
    ``/approve`` ``sha``.

    For a VERDICT (approve / request changes) this route also re-reads the PR's live
    head and refuses a moved one with **409 ``review_conflict``**, which is what
    actually closes the stale-approval hole. The provider parameters alone do NOT:
    GitLab's ``sha`` is a real precondition, but GitHub's ``commit_id`` is only
    ATTRIBUTION — GitHub accepts a review naming a non-head commit and records it
    there, and whether that stale approval still counts toward branch protection
    depends on the repo's "dismiss stale approvals" setting. So an unchecked approval
    could satisfy protection on code nobody read wherever dismissal is off. Same shape
    as ``_handle_pull_merge``: the app does the check it cannot delegate.

# Provider merge-state values that mean "this PR's protections are SATISFIED".
#
# The distinction this encodes is the whole safety story of the direct merge, and it is
# easy to get wrong: GitHub's ``mergeable`` means only "no merge CONFLICTS". A PR whose
# required reviews or required checks have not passed is ``mergeable: true`` with
# ``mergeable_state: "blocked"``. For an ordinary user the merge endpoint then answers
# 405, so the provider is the backstop — but a repository ADMIN may hold
# bypass-branch-protection, and for them the provider would honour the merge. Gating on
# ``mergeable`` alone therefore offered a privileged user a one-click way to land a PR
# its own rules had rejected.
#
#   clean      — GitHub: mergeable, protections satisfied
#   has_hooks  — GitHub: clean, with pre-receive hooks configured
#   mergeable  — GitLab `detailed_merge_status`: no conflicts AND approval rules,
#                blocking discussions and required pipelines all satisfied
#
# `unstable` is deliberately EXCLUDED. It is usually described as "only non-required
# checks are failing", and that reading is what an earlier revision allowed — but the
# state does not actually distinguish a failing REQUIRED check from a failing optional
# one, so it cannot be used to conclude the protections are satisfied. For an ordinary
# user the provider would refuse anyway; for the admin this gate exists to protect
# against, allowing it would land code over a red required check. A gate that cannot
# tell must refuse: the PR is still one click from `auto_merge`, which lets the provider
# decide once the checks finish.
#
# GitLab's LEGACY `can_be_merged` is excluded for exactly that reason, and it is the
# subtler case. `_norm_pull` falls back to the old `merge_status` field when
# `detailed_merge_status` is absent (a pre-16.x server, or a payload that omits it), and
# `merge_status` reports ONLY whether the branches conflict — it is GitLab's exact
# analogue of GitHub's `mergeable`, and knows nothing about unmet approvals, unresolved
# blocking discussions or a red required pipeline. Accepting it therefore reproduced the
# very hole this set exists to close, on the older servers least likely to be watched. A
# server that cannot say more than "no conflicts" gets the refusal and the auto-merge
# path, not the benefit of the doubt.
#
# Everything else is refused HERE rather than left to the provider: `blocked`
# (protections unsatisfied), `behind`, `dirty`, `draft`, `unknown`, and GitLab's
