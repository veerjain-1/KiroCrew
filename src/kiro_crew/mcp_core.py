"""MCP server exposing spawn, learn, and task tools to kiro-cli.

Runs as ``kirocrew mcp-core`` — kiro-cli spawns it as a child process
and calls tools via JSON-RPC over stdio (MCP protocol).

Tools:
    spawn_run       — spawn a background subagent
    spawn_list      — list running/completed subagents
    spawn_status    — retrieve full subagent output
    resource_status — check host resource headroom before heavy work
    learn_add       — save a learned correction
    learn_list      — list all lessons
    learn_remove    — remove lessons by substring
    task_run        — start the autonomous task runner

       lookup, but ONLY when the HMAC sidecar written by the gateway
       verifies (:func:`kiro_crew.session_pid_sig.verify_session_pid`).
       PID-namespace sandboxing strips ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` from the
       sandboxed env, but the sandbox launcher exports its OWN host pid
       (``sandbox.py``) — exactly the pid the gateway keys
       ``session_pid_<pid>.txt`` by on session claim. The bare ``.txt``
       file is agent-writable and therefore forgeable; the sidecar is
       signed with the SEL trust root (``sel_hmac.key``), which agents
       cannot read, and binds the pid into the MAC so another pid's
       pair cannot be replayed. Without this branch,
       ``monitor_start``/``monitor_update``/``autonudge_stop``/``set_project``
       fail closed
       in every sandboxed dashboard session even though the session is
       fully identified.

    Returns ``""`` when only the ``/proc`` ancestor WALK would have
    matched, or when the sidecar is missing/invalid. The walk stays
    excluded: a subagent spawned via ``spawn_run`` lives under the
    parent slot's process tree, so walking ancestors from its MCP-core
    child silently resolves to the parent — which would let the
    subagent mutate state on the wrong slot. Read-only callers (audit,
    telemetry) keep the lenient resolver where misattribution is
    harmless.

    Source 0 (accepted BEFORE both of the above): the gateway-injected
    per-call caller context. In the pooled topology gatewayd strips any
    client-forged ``kirocrew.caller`` block on every inbound frame and
    injects its own (built from the uid-gated claim-push at ``rekey()``),
    so a context present here is gateway-authored — strictly stronger
    provenance than the env var, and the ONLY correct identity in a
    shared backend serving many sessions. This is what keeps
    ``send_notification`` working for warm-pool sessions on platforms
    without the sandbox launcher (macOS/Windows), where neither env
    source exists in the backend process.
