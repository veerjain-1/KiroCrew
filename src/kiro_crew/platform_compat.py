#
# This does NOT restrict a user's EXPLICIT navigation: an operation whose root

# scoped by definition and never consults this set. macOS still shows its own

    preflight failure rather than suppressed. On the failure path probe files
    are best-effort removed; one may remain only when removal itself is what

    This is the pid that ACQUIRED the lock, which is not always a live process:
    an ``flock`` belongs to the open file description, so when the acquirer dies
    and a forked child still holds the inherited fd, the kernel keeps reporting
    the DEAD acquirer here. Verified on Linux 5.x -- an orphaned lock listed
    ``FLOCK ADVISORY WRITE <dead parent pid>`` while the surviving child held the
    fd. So a returned pid that is dead is positive evidence of an inherited fd,
    and no ``/proc`` surface names the inheritor: use
    :func:`pids_holding_file` for candidates and do not present them as owners.

    Returns ``None`` on non-Linux, when ``/proc/locks`` is unreadable, or when no
    ``FLOCK`` entry matches the file. Blocked waiters (``->`` rows) are skipped.

    Matching is on the full ``major:minor:inode`` triple that ``/proc/locks``
    prints, because inode numbers are only unique WITHIN a filesystem -- an
    unrelated flock on another device can share this inode's number, and
    accepting it would name a completely unrelated process. The device halves are
    hex (``%02x``), the inode decimal (``%lu``). On filesystems whose ``s_dev``
    differs from the ``st_dev`` that ``stat`` reports (btrfs subvolumes and
    overlayfs use anonymous devices) the triple will not match and this returns
    ``None``. That is the safe direction to fail: the caller degrades to its
    "holder could not be identified" wording instead of naming a wrong process.
