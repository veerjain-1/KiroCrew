"""Run-marker so remote token-mint targets the *running* gateway's install.

The problem this solves:
    Token mint SSHes to the remote desktop and runs ``kirocrew token`` resolved
    from a fixed PATH candidate list (:data:`token_mint.REMOTE_BIN_CANDIDATES`,
    first entry ``$HOME/.local/bin/kirocrew``). When that launcher symlinks into
    an *uninstalled* git worktree (no ``.venv``), every mint fails with
    "KiroCrew venv not found" — even though the gateway itself is up and healthy,
    because it runs from a *different* venv. The user's sync -> rebuild -> restart
    of the gateway can't fix mint, since mint never consults the gateway's own
    install. The proactive/reactive token-refresh loop then re-mints on every
    poll and fails, which surfaces as the pane periodically disconnecting and
    reconnecting.

The fix:
    At startup the gateway records the absolute path to *its own* ``kirocrew``
    launcher, keyed by the port it serves, at
    ``<config_dir>/run/gateway-<port>.bin``. The mint shell snippet reads that
    marker first and, when it names an executable, ``exec``s it — guaranteeing
    mint uses the same built venv as the live gateway. An absent/stale marker
    (older remotes, or a gateway that isn't running) makes mint fall back to the
    candidate search, so nothing regresses.

Trust: the marker lives in the ``0700`` ``run/`` dir (owner-only) and is written
``0600`` by the gateway itself; the dir is on the ``is_sensitive_path`` floor
(``security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS``) so agent file tools cannot write it. That
write boundary — not an ownership check on the mint side — is what bounds who can
plant a marker; the mint side additionally only ``exec``s the path when it is an
executable file (``-x``), the same boundary as the pre-existing
``~/.local/bin/kirocrew`` candidate.

Second consumer — port discovery:
    The marker's *filename* also advertises which port a gateway is serving, so
    :func:`marker_ports` lets a local client command (``token`` / ``status`` /
    ``logout`` / ``stop``, via ``port_resolution.resolve_client_port``) find a gateway
    on a non-default port with zero configuration. That path reads only the
    filename, never the recorded launcher path.

    A marker is NOT proof a gateway is there: :func:`clear_marker` runs only on
    graceful shutdown, so a crash or SIGKILL leaves the file behind and an
    unrelated process may since have bound that port. Because client commands
    send the local secret (``X-Local-Secret``) to whatever is listening, the
    consumer MUST verify the listener before trusting a discovered port, using
    the pid sidecar this module writes beside the marker (:func:`read_pid`) — see
    ``port_resolution._gateway_owns_port``. This module deliberately does not offer a
    bare "is something listening" helper, so no caller can mistake reachability
    for identity.
