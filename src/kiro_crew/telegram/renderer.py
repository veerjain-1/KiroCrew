"""Layer 2b -- Telegram ``Renderer`` + interactive approval decider.

``TelegramRenderer`` maps the channel-neutral ``OutputEvent`` stream (routed by
the base :class:`Renderer`'s ``dispatch``) onto Telegram's Bot API:

* ``on_turn_start`` -- typing indicator + a "🤔 …" placeholder message.
* ``on_text_chunk`` -- throttled ``editMessageText`` streaming (typewriter),
  with any trailing ``[OPTIONS:]`` markup held back from the visible stream.
* ``on_tool_call`` -- a transient ``🔧 {tool}…`` footer.
* ``on_prompt_choice`` -- inline Approve/Deny buttons as a SEPARATE message
  (so streaming edits don't clobber them); byte-safe ``callback_data``.
* ``on_compaction`` -- a lightweight "compacting…" note.
* ``on_done`` -- the final edit, splitting long output at the capability's
  char cap and attaching the ``[OPTIONS:]`` inline keyboard to the last chunk.

``TelegramApprovalDecider`` is the interactive ladder's awaiter: ``__call__``
registers a Future keyed by ``session:request_id`` and awaits a button press,
denying by default on timeout; the callback handler resolves it via
``resolve_global``.

Dependency direction is ``telegram -> messaging`` (allowed).
